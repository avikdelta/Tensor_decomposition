# Tensor Decomposition Algorithms

This repo has implementations of different tensor decomposition algorithms for latent variable models e.g. GMM, LDA 

These codes were used for baseline comparison in the following paper.

The basic tensor decomposition algorithm based on robust tensor power iterations is described in the paper;
